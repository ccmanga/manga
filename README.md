An online and offline Manga reading application for Android.

This Android application allows users to browse a catalogue of mangas from various sources in a local SQLite database. From this activity, users can either read a chapter online or add it to queue for a later download. When reading a chapter, the user has various reading controls and image gestures. 

This catalogue can be searched by name and filtered by genres, status, name, and rank. Similarly, users can fetch latest updates for their chosen source. Clicking a manga, launches the MangaActivity in which they can view more information about a chosen manga and a list of available chapters. 

The application allows the users to maintain their own libraries of downloaded manga, favourite manga, and recent chapters.
